## WHAT IS NANVIX? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nanvix/nanvix.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/nanvix/nanvix)  [![Join us on Slack!](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20Slack-e01563.svg)](https://join.slack.com/t/nanvix/shared_invite/enQtMzY2Nzg5OTQ4NTAyLTAxMmYwOGQ0ZmU2NDg2NTJiMWU1OWVkMWJhMWY4NzMzY2E1NTIyMjNiOTVlZDFmOTcyMmM2NDljMTAzOGI1NGY)  

Nanvix is a Unix like operating system created by Pedro H. Penna to
address emerging manycore platforms. It targets cluster-based
architectures that rely on a distributed and shared memory
configuration, and it was designed from scratch to deliver cutting
edge performance, while enabling backward compatibility with
existing software.
